=====
Aligning genomic data is a fundamental but difficult (NP-hard) problem in Biology. We developed Phylo, a casual video game which solutions are used to compare genomes.  In this project, we implemented a complete gaming framework and an API for human-computing video games in genomics.  <b>Come help solve science through playing games!</b>

I want to contribute!

Getting Started
=====
Fork it! Then let me know if you have a new module or bug fix and ill integrate it in :)
We use Mariontte! You can easily create an <a href='https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.itemview.md'>Marionette Itemview</a> to create modules / components.

We've based our boilerplate from this <a href='https://github.com/alfredkam/Boilerplates/tree/master/Marionette'>repo</a>

Devices Supported
=====
Current version supports most major browsers (except IE 6-8) and tablet browsers with screen size bigger than 1024px * 768px.  Tablets have their own custome UX <br>

For legacy code that was dedicated to the mobile phones, please visit the archive branch.
